      <h2>
        My name is Sofia Calderon. I am currently at a student at the University of Rhode Island. This is my first Computer Science course at the University and I am excited to learn everything I can from it. 
         A few things about me is that I love animals, especially dogs. I am in the Air National Guard; I have been in the military for almost two years now and lastly, I enjoy watching movies and shows on my free time.
