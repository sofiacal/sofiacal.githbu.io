      my name is Sofia Calderon Alzate. I live in Cranston, RI and I am currently attenidng the University of Rhode Island. As of right now I am majoring in Secondary Education 
      but I am interested in the Computer Science Major. This is my first computer science course I have taken while being at college. I hope to learn more about this feild and potentially major in this in the future. 
      Technology is essentially our future; everything we do and see has been manipulated by technology. Rather than running towards the other direction, I will try to learn everything I can and use the knowledge to my advantage. 
      This website will show my progress in this course and my abilities to code certian areas, such as images, colors, backgrounds, and links.
